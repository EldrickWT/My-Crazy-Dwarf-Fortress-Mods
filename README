Structure:

.X The version it SHOULD work for.

43.05 is NOW TESTING. Brace for Impact.

data.X - the colors, inits, worldgen, speeches, modded fortressintro modded
    "human_trade_bye", and modded monarch
dfhack.X - an outdated backup of my dfhack plugin source files, AND the scripts folder.
    Now then not all is mine in there... some are straight off the forums.
    Most everything should work for versions prior to 40.06. More Below.
Holding Pen - See Below.
raw-notes.X - all the (notes, addendums, apocrypha, and some experiments) for my mod(s)
raw-notes.31.25 - the above for 31.25... or at least the contents of the zips that should
    have been the 31.25 data ^^;
raw.X - a big merge of all my mods and all other mods I've added to My Little Arachnids
    and or Aspectus Lolin.
split out mods.X - all my mods in individual packages.
split out mods.31.25 - the contents of the 31.25 zips ...

Errata: Version blahblahblah arrived .. find .. slipping .. radar.

	So. Increased the civ counts from 1... after a world where an entire civ just
	abandoned everything right before world gen ended. Did they all go Necromancer?
dfhack.X: 
    I have a DFHACK fork now... So only sentiment keeps the dfhack.x chain around for the
    time being. In time I may delete all traces on this repo, as the files are all meer
    inches away. At least I'm not strange enough to FORCE them onto one repo. Because it
    would be a 30 Inch Cube going into a 15 Inch Round Hole.

Holding Pen: Currently contains files from the C_V testing. See previous README for details.
