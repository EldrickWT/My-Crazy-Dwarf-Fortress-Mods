Wiki for the Mods:
N/A


Structure:

data - the colors, inits, worldgen, speeches, and my modded fortressintro
dfhack - a backup of my dfhack plugin source files. They're in the plugin/devel folder. movein needs serious work (it's old and "tweak makeown" works a bit better). everything else in there works.
Holding Pen - If something is being worked on an original -likely broken- will be here.
raw-notes - all the (notes, addendums, apocrypha, and some experiments) for my mod(s) a few newly updated for 0.34.11
raw-notes.31.25 - the above for 31.25... or at least the contents of the zips that should have been the 31.25 data ^^;
raw - a big merge of all my mods and all other mods I've added to My Little Arachnids and or Aspectus Lolin. 0.34.11
split out mods - all my mods in individual packages. 0.34.11
split out mods - 31.25 - the contents of the 31.25 zips ...
