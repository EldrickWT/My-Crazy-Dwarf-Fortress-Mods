A Playable Pregenned Region Download (34.11):
http://dffd.wimbli.com/file.php?id=8353 34.11 r4
Download (40.0X) -in the works... to think I /almost/ loaded a crashable save (40.02)


Structure:

.X The version it SHOULD work for. 31.25 content is still spelled out for cautionary reasons. 40.01 dirs will
be gone soon. Paranoia Sucks.

40.04 is the most current. 40.03's raws are compatible.

data.X - the colors, inits, worldgen, speeches, and my modded fortressintro
dfhack.X - a backup of my dfhack plugin source files, AND the scripts folder. Now then not all is mine in there... some
    are straight off the forums. Most everything should work.
Holding Pen - If something is being worked on an original -likely broken- will be here.
raw-notes.X - all the (notes, addendums, apocrypha, and some experiments) for my mod(s)
raw-notes.31.25 - the above for 31.25... or at least the contents of the zips that should have been the 31.25 data ^^;
raw.X - a big merge of all my mods and all other mods I've added to My Little Arachnids and or Aspectus Lolin.
split out mods.X - all my mods in individual packages.
split out mods.31.25 - the contents of the 31.25 zips ...

Errata: The Trade Breaking Bugs are really annoying. At least with fastdwarf they happen faster :/
