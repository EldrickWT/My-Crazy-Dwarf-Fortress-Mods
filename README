Structure:

.X The version it SHOULD work for.

44.06 is NOW TESTING. No raw changes from 44.05

data.X - the colors, inits, worldgen, speeches, modded fortressintro modded
    "human_trade_bye", and modded monarch
dfhack.X - an outdated backup of my dfhack plugin source files, AND the scripts folder.
    Now then not all is mine in there... some are straight off the forums.
    Most everything should work for versions prior to 40.06. More Below.
Holding Pen - See Below.
raw-notes.X - all the (notes, addendums, apocrypha, and some experiments) for my mod(s)
raw-notes.31.25 - the above for 31.25... or at least the contents of the zips that should
    have been the 31.25 data ^^;
raw.X - a big merge of all my mods and all other mods I've added to My Little Arachnids
    and or Aspectus Lolin.
split out mods.X - all my mods in individual packages.
split out mods.31.25 - the contents of the 31.25 zips ...

Errata: Version 44.06 arrived... but I hear 44.07 might be soon. Oh well. I haven't
	posted these in forever so now is as good a time as any I guess.

	Got hit kinda hard by all the not-able-to-worship and no-drinks for critters mess.
	OTHERWISE things have mostly been golden since last UPLOADED set of files. RAW-wise
dfhack.X: 
    I have a DFHACK fork now... So only sentiment keeps the dfhack.x chain around for the
    time being. In time I may delete all traces on this repo, as the files are all meer
    inches away. At least I'm not strange enough to FORCE them onto one repo. Because it
    would be a 30 Inch Cube going into a 15 Inch Round Hole.

Holding Pen: Currently contains files from the C_V testing. See previous README for details.
