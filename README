Structure:

.X The version it SHOULD work for.

40.23 is the most current... almost no REAL raw changes from 40.13 NOT that I uploaded that...

data.X - the colors, inits, worldgen, speeches, modded fortressintro modded
    "human_trade_bye", and modded monarch
dfhack.X - an outdated backup of my dfhack plugin source files, AND the scripts folder.
    Now then not all is mine in there... some are straight off the forums.
    Most everything should work for versions prior to 40.06
Holding Pen - See Below.
raw-notes.X - all the (notes, addendums, apocrypha, and some experiments) for my mod(s)
raw-notes.31.25 - the above for 31.25... or at least the contents of the zips that should
    have been the 31.25 data ^^;
raw.X - a big merge of all my mods and all other mods I've added to My Little Arachnids
    and or Aspectus Lolin.
split out mods.X - all my mods in individual packages.
split out mods.31.25 - the contents of the 31.25 zips ...

Errata: Kegs are still the biggest change this version... even considering 40.10 is out.

dfhack.X: 
    I have a DFHACK fork now... So only sentiment keeps the dfhack.x chain around for the
    time being. In time I may delete all traces on this repo, as the files are all meer
    inches away. At least I'm not strange enough to FORCE them onto one repo. Because it
    would be a 30 Inch Cube going into a 15 Inch Round Hole.

Holding Pen: Currently contains files from the C_V testing. This includes phase 1 testing
    (ZAPALLTAGS and the Bouldersaurian files) and the Phase 0 and Phase 2 testing
    (c_v petciv). It's 0 and 2 as it was the catalyst/event 0, and a post zapalltags phase
    as well.

    In c_variation_zapalltags.txt we have C_V ZAPALLTAGS itself which includes every TOKEN
    in use in a my raw directory with only the CURIOUSBEAST tokens enabled.
    Also has a trimmed down C_V CRASH which will CTD if you put the C_V file
    and creature_bouldersaurian.txt into a given raw\objects directory and run an arena
    test. I've deleted a copy of PET_CIV from the file as that is now right next to this
    C_V.

    In c_variation_pet_civ.txt we have the otherwise innocent C_V that adding the
    CURIOUSBEAST removal tags to caused the whole mess to begin with. We also have a
    CTD positive version of PET_CIV (PET_CIV2) which matches the Phase 0/Event 0 version
    of the file. When it was added to the creature_pedoness.txt to try to remove any of
    the three CURIOUSBEAST tags Crashed Dwarf Fortress.

    I've also tested it (Phase 2) by just adding PET_CIV2 instead of PET_CIV to the
    creature_fab.txt (a creature that has never had a CURIOUSBEAST tag) and CTD'd just as
    easily. I did try mixing it up... and found CURIOUSBEAST_ITEM to be the lesser
    of the three evils. The other two seem to be all you need. Even singly. THAT SAID
    it could be some pure overload of C_V data... GAITs, attacks, and the PET_CIV might
    just be too much. Only the Toady One would know.
